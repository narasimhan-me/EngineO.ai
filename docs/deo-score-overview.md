# DEO Score – Overview

The DEO Score is EngineO.ai's primary metric for how discoverable your brand is across search engines and AI assistants.

At a high level, the DEO Score combines:

- **Entity coverage & correctness**
- **Answer-ready content quality**
- **Technical health & crawlability**
- **Multi-engine visibility signals (SEO, AEO, PEO, VEO)**
- **Freshness and stability over time**

EngineO.ai uses this score to prioritize recommendations, automations, and reporting.

> Implementation details, formulas, and API shapes will be documented in later phases.
