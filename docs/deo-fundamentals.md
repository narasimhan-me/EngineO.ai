# DEO Fundamentals

EngineO.ai is built around Discovery Engine Optimization (DEO): the practice of optimizing your brand for how people and AI systems actually discover, interpret, and surface your content.

DEO (Discovery Engine Optimization) = **SEO + AEO + PEO + VEO**

- **SEO** – Search Engine Optimization (Google, Bing, etc.)
- **AEO** – Answer Engine Optimization (AI assistants and answer boxes)
- **PEO** – Presence Engine Optimization (knowledge panels, profiles, entities)
- **VEO** – Visibility Engine Optimization (multi-surface visibility across channels)

This section explains how EngineO.ai models entities, answers, content, and signals to compute your DEO Score and drive recommendations.

> Detailed implementation docs are coming soon. For now, use this page as the conceptual overview of DEO inside EngineO.ai.
