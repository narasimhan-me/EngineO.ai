# Entities & Knowledge Graph – Overview

EngineO.ai treats your brand, products, services, and key topics as **entities**, not just keywords.

Entities power:

- Knowledge panels and presence surfaces
- Internal and external linking strategies
- Consistent metadata across search engines and AI assistants
- Better DEO Scores through structured understanding of your brand

This document explains the conceptual model for entities inside EngineO.ai and how they connect to DEO Score, content, and automation.

> Detailed schemas, APIs, and UI flows will be added as the entities feature is implemented.
