# Answer-Ready Content – Overview

Answer-ready content is content that can be safely and confidently surfaced by search engines and AI assistants as a direct answer.

In EngineO.ai, answer-ready content is:

- Mapped to entities and intents
- Structured for snippet and answer box extraction
- Enriched with AI-friendly metadata
- Measured as a key input into your DEO Score

This document introduces how EngineO.ai thinks about answer units and how they will be surfaced in the UI and API.

> Detailed specifications for answer units and templates will be added as the feature is implemented.
